# Achievements

* For the first time in the last two decades, carry out projects in coordination with multiple countries in the Andean Region.

* Develop institutional awareness about Astrononomy for Development.

# Challenges

* Most of the events have been coordinated and held in Colombia.
  Suggested solution: move the coordination center to a country different from Colombia.
  
* Only a minority of the projects suggested in the original programme have advanced.
